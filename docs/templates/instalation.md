## System requirements
Backup Juggler requires [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (it was developed with Python 3.11, so we do not guarantee it will work with earlier versions). It is cross-platform and the goal is to make it work equally well on Linux, macOS and Windows.

## How to install?
To install the Backup Juggler CLI, we recommend that you use [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx). It installs Python CLI applications globally while still isolating them in virtual environments, managing upgrades and uninstalls.

1. Install Backup Juggler:
```bash
pipx install backup-juggler
```
2. Update Backup Juggler:
```bash
pipx upgrade backup-juggler
```
3. Uninstall Backup Juggler:
```bash
pipx uninstall backup-juggler
```

Although this is just a recommendation! You can also install the project with the manager of your choice.
